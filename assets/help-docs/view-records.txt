Select [bold][bright_cyan]View Records[/][/] from the Main Menu.
A table will appear, showing results of previous tests. Each row within
this table is an individual record.

These records are retrieved from a Google Sheets spreadsheet in which
records are created after each test process is completed.

You may also view records from the Google Sheets spreadsheet; however,
you must have access to the spreadsheet to do so. Contact your
organisation's admin to request access.

If you add or delete a record, changes may not be visible until the
program has restarted.
