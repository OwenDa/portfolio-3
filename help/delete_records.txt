Select [bold][bright_cyan]View Records[/][/] from the Main Menu.
A table will appear, showing results of previous tests. Each row within
this table is an individual record. These records are retrieved from a
Google Sheets spreadsheet.

There are two ways to delete a record. Either method will permanently
delete the record from [bold]both[/] the table and the spreadsheet:
1. Within T-Tester
2. Within the spreadsheet.

[bold]Deleting a record within T-Tester[/]
Using this method, you may only delete the last record shown on the table.
Ensure this is the record you wish to delete before proceding any further.
To proceed, select "Delete Last Record Shown" from the Options menu below the
table. To do this, simply type the corresponding number and press Enter.

A warning message will appear, "Caution: Deletion cannot be undone." To confirm
deletion, type "DELETE". To cancel this process without making changes, press
Enter or type any key followed by Enter.

[bold]Deleting a record from the spreadsheet.[/]
Using this method, you can delete any record or multiple records at once.
You must have access to the spreadsheet. Contact your organisation's admin if
you are unsure whether this is permissable or need to be granted access.

Within the Google Sheets spreadsheet, highlight the row that contains the
record you wish to delete by clicking on the row number at the left side of the
screen. Press the Delete key on your keyboard. This will delete the record.
