For more information and in-depth help, you can view the program's README file
on GitHub: https://github.com/OwenDa/portfolio-3#readme

The README will provide you with a few examples regarding the use of the
independent t-test (the particular type of t-test used by T-Tester), as well
as some sample datasets that can be used to try out the various possible outcomes
of testing. It will also give you a detailed breakdown of the error messages and
prompts you might receive upon entering an invalid value when prompted for input
(e.g. entering a letter when asked for a number), and other useful information.

T-Tester was developed in 2022 as a learning and portfolio project and is
currently intended for demonstration and further learning purposes only.
