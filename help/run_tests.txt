You will then be asked to enter a username/ID. Type your chosen username
and press Enter. Your organisation may have its own protocol for usernames,
such as an ID number or initials.

When prompted, enter the number of subjects in your first sample.
This must be an integer (ie. "5", not "five" or "5.0").
After pressing enter, you will be asked to confirm.

You will now be asked to input the values within that sample. You may type them
individually or use copy/paste. They must be comma separated (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5).
Submit the information by pressing Enter and then confirm. You will be asked to
repeat the relevant steps for the second sample.  The program will carry out
tests and relay the results.
